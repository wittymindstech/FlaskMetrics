# FlaskMetrics
Generate Custom Metrics Using Flask

`docker-compose up --build`

Once the containers are running, you can access the API at http://localhost:9099/ and the Prometheus dashboard at http://localhost:9090. 
The /metrics endpoint of the API will expose the metrics that Prometheus can scrape.
